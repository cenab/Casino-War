Comments(no newline allowed): In this game, I used text files to record in autoplay which I think what is special abount my code. My code creates and deletes the contents of the files when it is quited from the game. In the main, function I call another function called game so that I can record all the variables in. Also for the stats part, I had to use floating values because it got error which I honestly fixed by turning the values into floats. If you run autoplay, without buying, playing and quitting in this order and if you call quit first it tends to give error.
